<h2>Planneur stratÃ©gique Freelance &amp; Intervenante StratÃ©gie Digitale ğŸŒ¿</h2><p>Planneur stratÃ©gique Freelance &amp; Intervenante en stratÃ©gie.Â <span>I'm a French girl with a strong accent in love with Strategic Planning, Social media and Manuel Neuer.Â </span><span>Open-minded, empowered and emphatic, I'm interested in consumer behaviour and brand strategy. Web designer &amp; project manager in a previous life, I was trained to do, create, feel and test. I like to immerse myself totally in unknown worlds. I have this visceral need to grasp the Why and understand what surrounds me - which sometimes opens incongruous doors.</span></p>
